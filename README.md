# showrssd
showrss.info downloader

It only need universal feed parser library (feedparser.py). I tested 5.1.3 version.

All the settings are in settings.py file:
- The showrss.info user id
- A download directory where utorrent/transmission can get the torrent files
- Enable disc space alert log file and email notifications
- In the last case, can be setted the email account to send the emails and set the destinators

this software can be used with cron to automatize the downloading of tv shows.
